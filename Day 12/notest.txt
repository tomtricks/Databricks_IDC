MLflow Basics

Core MLflow Components
MLflow Tracking: An API and UI for logging parameters, code versions, metrics, and artifacts during model training.
MLflow Models: A standardized packaging format that allows models from any library (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, LangChain) to be used across diverse deployment tools.
MLflow Model Registry: A centralized repository for managing model versions, lineage, and lifecycle transitions (e.g., from development to production). 

Experiment Tracking & Logging
Databricks uses Experiments as organizational units to group related Runs. 
Automatic Logging: Databricks Autologging is enabled by default on ML Runtime clusters. It automatically captures model parameters, metrics, and files when you use supported libraries like Scikit-learn or XGBoost.
Manual Logging: Use the mlflow.log_param(), mlflow.log_metric(), and mlflow.log_artifact() APIs for granular control.
Model Logging: Models are saved using mlflow.<flavor>.log_model(). In MLflow 3, this creates a Logged Model object that links metrics and parameters directly to the model throughout its lifecycle. 

MLflow UI in Databricks
The UI provides a visual interface to manage and compare your work: 
Experiment Page: Displays all runs within an experiment. You can compare runs side-by-side using charts and tables to identify the best-performing models.
Run Details: Clicking a run shows its specific parameters, metrics, and the Artifacts section, which contains the logged model and automatically generated code snippets for loading it.
Models Tab: In MLflow 3, this tab within the Experiment UI allows you to search and filter Logged Models based on metrics and tags across different environments. 

Unity Catalog Integration (2026 Standard) 
For enterprise governance, the Model Registry is now typically backed by Unity Catalog (databricks-uc). 
Namespace: Models use a three-level namespace: <catalog>.<schema>.<model_name>.
Lifecycle Management: Use Aliases (e.g., @champion, @challenger) instead of legacy "stages" to promote models to production.
Lineage: Unity Catalog tracks lineage from the original training dataset and experiment run all the way to production serving.
