Unity Catalog Governance

1. Catalog → Schema → Table hierarchy
  
Catalog: The top-level container used to organize data assets, often mirroring business units (e.g., finance, marketing) or environments (e.g., prod, dev).
Schema: Also known as a database, this is the second layer used to group related tables, views, and functions.
Table/Volume: The lowest level of the hierarchy where the actual data resides.

2. Access Control (GRANT/REVOKE)
Unity Catalog centralizes permissions using standard SQL syntax across all workspaces. 
Hierarchical Inheritance: Permissions granted at a higher level automatically cascade down to lower levels. 
For example, granting SELECT on a Catalog gives a user read access to all Schemas and Tables within that catalog.

Syntax:
GRANT <privilege> ON <object_type> <object_name> TO <principal>;
REVOKE <privilege> ON <object_type> <object_name> FROM <principal>;
Common Privileges: Include SELECT (read), MODIFY (write), USE CATALOG, and USE SCHEMA. 


3. Data Lineage
Unity Catalog automatically captures lineage at both the table and column levels. 
Automatic Tracking: Captures data movement and transformations across notebooks, SQL queries, jobs, and dashboards without manual configuration.
Visibility: Lineage can be viewed visually in Catalog Explorer or queried programmatically via system tables.
Security Integration: Users only see lineage for objects they have permission to access.
Cross-Workspace: Aggregates lineage across all workspaces attached to the same metastore. 


4. Managed vs. External Tables
The choice of table type determines who manages the underlying data files and their lifecycle. 

Managed tables keep both data and metadata within Databricks-controlled storage, with data deleted when the table is dropped, ideal for simplicity and performance; 
External tables store data in user-managed external storage (like S3/ADLS), so dropping the table only removes metadata, preserving the raw data for flexibility and control over storage costs, making them great for data lake scenarios. 
  
Managed tables are fully integrated and auto-optimized.
while external tables offer manual control over data lifecycle outside Databricks.
