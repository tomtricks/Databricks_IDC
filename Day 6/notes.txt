Medallion Architecture

Bronze (Raw Data):
Immutability: Land data AS-IS, keeping a perfect history of source systems.
Metadata: Add load timestamps, source IDs, and process info.
Schema Enforcement: Use schema-on-read or defined contracts to capture changes (schema drift).
Reprocessing: Enables replaying transformations without hitting source systems.
Silver (Cleaned/Enriched):
Data Quality: Deduplicate, standardize formats (e.g., phone numbers), enforce data types.
Enrichment: Apply basic joins, calculate derived fields (e.g., age from DOB).
Data Modeling: Can use Data Vault or conform to a single source of truth (SSOT).
Trustworthy Base: Becomes the reliable foundation for all downstream use.
Gold (Business-Ready):
Aggregation: Create fact/dimension tables (star/snowflake schemas).
Optimization: Denormalized, read-optimized formats (e.g., Delta Lake).
Use-Case Specific: Tailored for BI dashboards, reporting, or ML.
Shared Definitions: Agree on KPIs and business terms across teams.
