# Databricks_IDC
This repository is my personal learning log and resource hub for the Databricks AI Challenge, organized by Indian Data Club in collaboration with Databricks and Codebasics.
The main idea behind this repo is simple:
👉 learn consistently, document clearly, and share what I understand.

📌 What this repo is about

Tracking my daily learnings during the 14-day challenge

Storing notes, concepts, and examples related to:
* Databricks
* Data Engineering
* Apache Spark
* SQL
* Lakehouse concepts

Keeping links to resources, references, and practice materials

Maintaining a single place to reflect on what I learned and what’s next

This repo reflects my understanding at each stage — learning in progress.
It’s a learning journal + reference space that grows day by day.

🎯 Why I’m doing this

To build a strong foundation in Databricks & Data Engineering

To stay consistent instead of learning randomly

To have a clear record of my progress

To make learning visible and revisitable later

🔄 Ongoing & evolving

This repo will be updated daily during the challenge.
Content may be rough, refined, or revisited — that’s part of the learning process.
