Statistical Analysis & ML Prep

1. Descriptive Statistics
Analysts use Databricks to summarize and visualize data distributions before modeling. 
Lakehouse Monitoring: Automatically generates profiling data tables with metrics such as average, mean, and median for Delta tables in Unity Catalog.
Notebook Visualizations: Built-in charting tools allow for quick exploration of data distributions and correlations using SQL or Python.
PySpark/Pandas on Spark: Enables scalable calculation of standard deviations, quartiles, and frequency distributions on massive datasets. 

2. Hypothesis Testing
Databricks supports rigorous statistical testing to determine if data patterns are significant or due to chance. 
Core Tests: Common implementations include Chi-squared tests for independence, T-tests for comparing means, and Z-tests when population variance is known.
Libraries: Data scientists typically utilize scipy.stats or Spark’s MLlib for distributed statistical functions.
Null Hypothesis (H₀): Used in Databricks projects to assume no significant difference (e.g., "A new model performs no better than the existing one") until proven otherwise by a p-value below a significance level (typically 0.05). 

3. A/B Test Design
A/B testing (or split testing) in Databricks compares a control version (A) against a variant (B) to measure impact on key metrics. 
Experiment Setup: Populations are split into Control (no treatment) and Experiment groups.
ML Model Selection: Often used to compare a new ML model against a production baseline using metrics like click-through rate or conversion.
Tracking: MLflow integrated within Databricks logs parameters, metrics, and outcomes to compare test variations systematically. 

4. Feature Engineering
This process transforms raw data into high-quality inputs for ML models to improve accuracy. 
Databricks Feature Store: A centralized repository to define, find, and reuse features across the organization, ensuring consistency between training and serving.
Medallion Architecture: Data is incrementally cleaned and enriched as it moves from Bronze (raw) to Silver (transformed) and Gold (business-ready) layers.
Automated Tools: Auto Loader and Delta Live Tables simplify the ingestion and transformation of complex data into engineered features at scale.
